# Brain-Activity-Recognition-via-EEG-Signal-Classification
A picture of either a piano or a human was shown to 90 participants, while their EEG signals were recorded for 7 seconds. In this project we determine the moment when individuals could recognize whether the image depicts a human or a piano by segmenting the EEG 
signals over time, classifying these segments, and identifying the segment with the highest accuracy in determining the content of the picture.

The EEG signals were recorded using a 128-channel device, with a sampling rate of 500Hz, resulting in a total of 3500 samples recorded for each participant. 
With 90 participants involved in the trials, the dataset comprised dimensions of 128 channels by 3500 samples by 90 individuals. The labels assigned to the data points were either 'human' or 'piano'.
