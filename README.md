# Brain-Activity-Recognition-via-EEG-Signal-Classification
A picture of either a piano or a human was shown to 90 participants, while their EEG signals were recorded for 7 seconds. In this project we determine the moment when individuals could recognize whether the image depicts a human or a piano by segmenting the EEG 
signals over time, classifying these segments, and identifying the segment with the highest accuracy in determining the content of the picture.
